## Project Title:

Global energy consumption, carbon-dioxide emissions, and life expectancy

## Description:

The goal of this project was to examine the relationships if any between consumption of oil and coal and consequent carbon dioxide emissions per capita, and life expectancy globally. The period under study was narrowed down to between 1965 and 2014, and due to a lack of enough data for most countries, the final count of countries included in the study was sixty-five. To simplify the analysis due to the large amount of annual data provided for each of the sixty-five countries over the forty-nine year study period, the countries were classified into their respective continents, and the continental average numbers were analyzed under each of the following parameters:

1. Oil consumption per capita (measured in tonnes of oil equivalent)
2. Coal cosumption per capita (in tonnes of oil equivalent)
3. Carbon-dioxide emissions per capita (in tonnes of oil equivalent)
4. Average life expectancy (in years)

The individual parameters above were presented for each continent for comparison purposes, followed by a more detailed analysis to examine how much the consumptions and emissions have changed between 1965 and 2014, and pseudo-correlation analysis to see if there is any relationship between a continent's average carbon-dioxide emission and the average life expectancy of the countries comprising each continent.

## Analysis Tools:

The coding, analysis, and literature for this project were all done on Jupyter Notebook.
